    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The preparation is absolutely quick and simple with the whisking being the only time consuming part, if you want to say it that way.
         However, I would definitely recommend not rushing through this part, as this makes Omelette fluffier and there is nothing better 
         tasting in world than a cheesy and fluffy Omelette. With that let’s get going with the preparation.</p>
    


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <li>3 Eggs </li>
            <li>1 medium sized onion finely chopped</li>
              <li>¼th cup cilantro finely chopped</li>
               <li>¼ th cup grated processed cheese</li>
                  <li>2 green chilies finely chopped</li>
                   <li>1 tsp grated ginger</li>
                      <li>2 tbsp cooking oil</li>
                       <li>1 tsp salt</li>

                        <li>To begin making the Cheese Masala Omelette Recipe, chop tomatoes, onions, chillies and coriander leaves. Grate the required amount of cheese and keep aside. </li>
                        
                        <li>Break 2 eggs into a mixing bowl and add the chopped tomatoes, onions, green chillies, coriander leaves and grated cheese. Mix all the ingredients well to make a the omelette mixture.</li> 
                        
                        <li>Place an omelette pan on medium heat and add some oil to grease the pan. Once the pan in hot, reduce the flame to low and add the egg mixture to the pan. Make sure the egg mixture is equally spread across the pan. </li>
                        
                        <li> Cover the pan with the lid, so that the omelette gets cooked a little faster
                        
                            Remove the lid and check if the omelette has cooked. You can either flip the omelette to cook on the other side or fold the omelette in half and cover the pan again so that the cheese melts inside the omelette and all ingredients get cooked thoroughly 
                            
                            Keep the lid on for 30 seconds to minute and then turn off the flame. 
                            </li>
